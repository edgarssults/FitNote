# Description

An app for syncing OneNote pages to a Fitbit smartwatch.

It has unfortunately been discontinued due to issues with the Microsoft Graph API for OneNote. Most of the code has been removed from this repository, leaving only a shell.

# Installation

Available in the [Fitbit App Gallery](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/e8173d62-e539-4503-b4e3-5fbbaaf09fbc).

# Development

Follow the official [command line interface guide](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/) from Fitbit.

In VS Code command line run `npx fitbit`. Then run either `build` to build the app or `install` to install it on the simulator or device. Can also run `bi` to both build and install.
